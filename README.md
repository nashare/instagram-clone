# INSTAGRAM CLONE
# Project Description:
An application similar to InstaGram enables users to access a home page displaying various photos. Each photo is accompanied by its title, the authors' names, and the number of likes and comments received. Once authenticated, users can utilize the available functions to explore different sections of the program, including their profile page, creation page, saved photos page, and notifications page. Additionally, they have the option to log out when desired.

* Users can login with Google account.

* After logging in they will be presented to their home page.

* Users will then be able to comment or like on photos while also being able to add and delete photos.

* Give the user the ability to save or delete photos from their saved page.

* Give the user the ability to navigate to the notification page to see who has commented on their photos and/or liked their photos.

* Users on their profile page be able to change their name or avatar to meet their needs.

* Users can add, edit, or delete any comments that they have added to a posted photo.

* Users can log out and be redirected to the home page.
