# INSTAGRAM CLONE
# Project Description:
An application similar to InstaGram enables users to access a home page displaying various photos. Each photo is accompanied by its title, the authors' names, and the number of likes and comments received. Once authenticated, users can utilize the available functions to explore different sections of the program, including their profile page, creation page, saved photos page, and notifications page. Additionally, they have the option to log out when desired.

* Users have the option to log in using their Google account credentials.

*  Once logged in, they will be directed to their personalized home page.

*  From there, users can engage with the content by leaving comments or liking photos. They also have the ability to add new photos or delete existing ones.

*  A "saved" page is provided to users, where they can store their favorite photos or remove unwanted ones.

*  By navigating to the notification page, users can stay updated on who has commented on or liked their photos.

*  On their profile page, users can customize their name and avatar according to their preferences.

*  Users have full control over the comments they post on photos, being able to add, edit, or delete them as needed.

*  Finally, users can log out at any time, and upon doing so, they will be redirected back to the home page.
